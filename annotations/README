This folder contains new annotation file for the data set. 

The annotations are collected in 2022 within the context of another research project supported by TUBITAK 
with grant number 121E198 as a part of the Scientific and Technological Research Projects Funding Program (1001). 

Annotations are performed via blind listening of individual performances after listening to a few renditions of 
the melodic pattern by the experts. The files were presented in random order (after grouping samples in terms
of melodic patterns) (i.e. the expert annotated all samples of a melodic pattern in random order and moved to the 
next group of samples for the next melodic pattern). 

A 4-level grading system was used during the evaluations of the data set; 
1-Completely Off, 2-Major Mistakes, 3-Minor Mistakes, and 4-Perfect. 

Annotations were carried by 3 experts; a professor of musicology who has taken part as a jury member in entrance 
exam auditions, and two music conservatory students of graduate-level programs. The last two annotators re-annotated
all collection a few months after the first annotation task. The csv file contains 5 annotations in 5 columns where
two of these columns are for the repeated annotations. To facilitate analysis, we also added columns that carry a flag
if all annotations match (column: 'fullAgree'), the score/grade all annotations agreed on (column: 'fullAgree_score') 
and the majority score.
