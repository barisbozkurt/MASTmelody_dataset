This folder contains new annotation files for the data set. 

The annotations are collected in Summer 2022 within the context of another research project supported by TUBITAK 
with grant number 121E198 as a part of the Scientific and Technological Research Projects Funding Program (1001). 

Re-annotations are performed by two music conservatory students of graduate-level programs who assigned an overall 
grade via blind listening of individual performances after listening to a few renditions of the melodic pattern by 
the jury members.

A 4-level grading system was used during the evaluations of the data set; 
1-Completely Off, 2-Major Mistakes, 3-Minor Mistakes, and 4-Perfect.
